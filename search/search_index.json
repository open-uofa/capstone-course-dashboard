The users, professors and teaching assistants, will be able to view the course performance in three levels: the whole class, individual teams, and students. Performance is sliced by sprints and based on peer-review feedback, GitHub analytics and TA notes, which can be imported and parsed from CSV files and exported to CSV files. Key statistical data will be displayed in tables and charts for easy analyzing with more details available within. There are two administration levels, the superuser who is often the instructor is able to grant permission to TAs and both are able to view, comment, and flag teams and students. Data will be imported from csv files with import from the course portal and direct from google sheets under consideration. Ideally users can also reconfigure the dashboard for adding and removing a report or chart. Project Glossary Class A class represents the set of data recorded for a course. Instructor An instructor represents the owner of a class. They have full adminstrative privileges. TA A TA is a user whose account has a limited subset of an instructor's prvileges. Student A student represents a person attending a capstone course. They have class-related data and personal data associated with them but do not have an account. Team A team is a group of students working on the same project and contains aggregated data of all students within it. Peer-Review Feedback Peer-review feedback is assigned to a student within a team and contains the opinions of other team members for that student. Red Flag A red flag is an attribute assigned when some threshold is not met (such as number of commits). It is used by users to quickly identify possible issues. Note A note, also referred to as a comment, is a text field that users can attach to teams. Dashboard The dashboard is where users will see analytics of a class at multiple levels in various graphical formats. Sprint More generically a \"milestone\", these represent a time span during which teams dedicate themselves towards completing a specific set of features and tasks. Users can view what teams have completed each sprint.
